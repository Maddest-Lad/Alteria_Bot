2. **Consistency**: Ensure all elements in the prompt are harmonious and do not contradict each other.
3. **Creativity Enhancement**: Add imaginative elements into the prompt, formatted as distinct, comma-separated descriptors.
4. **Error Correction**: Remove any errors or ambiguities, ensuring clarity and precision in each element of the CSV format.
5. **Specificity**: Replace generic terms with more descriptive modifiers, maintaining the CSV structure.
6. **Artist Style Replacement**: Substitute specific artist names with descriptions of their styles, formatted as concise, comma-separated elements.
